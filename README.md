### Embedding a Machine- learning Model in a web Application

#### *Project Title: Sepsis-Analysis*

##### *Introduction*
Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection results in systemic inflammation throughout the body. It can lead to a cascade of changes that can damage multiple organ systems, causing them to fail.

Machine learning models can be consumed as restful APIs. Mostly, the real use of your ML model lies at the heart of an intelligent product – that may be a small component of a recommender system or an intelligent chatbot. These seem very difficult to overcome as the majority of ML practitioners use R/Python for their experiments whilst consumers of those ML models would be software engineers who use a completely different technology stack.
This problem can be easily solved with the building of APIs. Web APIs have made it easy for cross-language applications to work well. If a frontend developer needs to use your ML Model to create an ML-powered web application, they would just need to get the URL Endpoint from where the API is being served. 
In this project, we built an ML model, created a restful API for the model, and ultimately containerized the application with Docker.

|Age |	*patients age (years)* |
|Insurance | *If a patient holds a valid insurance card* |
|Sepssis |	*Positive: if a patient in ICU will develop a sepsis , and Negative: otherwise* |
 
##### **Objectives of the Project**

In this Project, we aim to work smoothly with the following objectives
1.	Balance Dataset & Feature Engineering
2.	Modeling and Model Improvement
3.	Build a FastAPI
4.	Build a docker container

###### **Analytical Questions**

- How does the Infections correlated.
- How infection progress to Sepsis.

###### **Hypothesis Testing**

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the speed of infection progression and the development of sepsis.
- Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The rapid progression of infection is associated with an increased likelihood of sepsis.
