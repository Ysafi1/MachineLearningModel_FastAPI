### Embedding a Machine- learning Model in a web Application
##### **Introduction**

Machine learning models can be consumed as restful APIs. Mostly, the real use of your ML model lies at the heart of an intelligent product – that may be a small component of a recommender system or an intelligent chatbot. These seem very difficult to overcome as the majority of ML practitioners use R/Python for their experiments whilst consumers of those ML models would be software engineers who use a completely different technology stack.
This problem can be easily solved with the building of APIs. Web APIs have made it easy for cross-language applications to work well. If a frontend developer needs to use your ML Model to create an ML-powered web application, they would just need to get the URL Endpoint from where the API is being served. 
In this project, we built an ML model, created a restful API for the model, and ultimately containerized the application with Docker.
 
##### **Objectives of the Project**

In this Project, we aim to work smoothly with the following objectives
1.	Balance Dataset & Feature Engineering
2.	Modeling and Model Improvement
3.	Build a FastAPI
4.	Build a docker container
